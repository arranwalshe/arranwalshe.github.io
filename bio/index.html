  <meta property="og:description" content="I am a researcher and writer specializing in Iraq and the politics and culture of the broader Middle East. I am currently serving as the Contributing Iraq Editor at Amwaj.media, and consult in a variety of humanitarian and analyst roles. In my work I collaborate with a diverse range of regional and international journalists, researchers, and practitioners to deliver insightful analysis on the region.
My current academic work centres around a book project derived from my Ph.D. research, which explores how cultures of sacrifice and martyrdom shape social service provision and reparations for victims of political violence in Iraq. Based off several years of ethnographic fieldwork in Iraq and the region, my work explores the intertwined, ethics, histories, and politics of international law, victimhood, and sacrifice.">
